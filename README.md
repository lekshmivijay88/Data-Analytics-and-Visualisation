# Data Analytics an Visualization on Stroke Data
Data analytics in healthcare is intended to help healthcare providers effectively share clinical data, provide personalized care to patients, detect diseases at an early stage, and in medical research. In addition, it also helps the hospital administration team to automate their processes and to manage the patient appointments.

## Aims and Objectives
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate my data analytics skills by applying appropriate data preparation techniques and performing detailed exploratory analysis on a healthcare dataset which in turn enables the visualization of valuable insights hidden in the data in the form of charts and plots. This project also aims to prove my ability to use multiple tools, techniques, and libraries used in the various stages of a data science project.

Accurate classification and identification of the people with a high risk of stroke can help to detect and treat the disease at an early stage thereby reducing the number of stroke deaths in the society.
This project involves the collection of the raw data related to stroke prediction, analyzing the prepared data to derive the information required to implement a stroke-prediction classification model based on ML algorithms. 

## Data Source
The raw data for this study i.e., the stroke prediction dataset is downloaded from the Kaggle website as a CSV file. The “stroke” feature is identified as the target (dependent) variable and the remaining features are independent variables.

## Observations
The observations and detailed findings are included in the file named Report.pdf
